## Working with AI
This deliverable is supported by AI tools, specifically ChatGPT-5, in several key ways. AI assistance was used to:
- **Version control guidance:** Prompts that provided Git/GitHub commands for resolving some conflicts and pushing changes to repo.  
- **Risk Register:** Prompts that helped reformat the risk register information into a GitHub-friendly table.
- **System Sketch:** Prompts to help adjust and debug system sketch issues in Mermaid syntax.
- **Evidence Base:** Prompts in reformating the Evidence Base with authoritative sources in GitHub-friendly APA format.  
- **AI lightweight:** Prompts to better understand how AI micro summmarizer feature will flow within the application.
- **Scope:** Prompts for out-of-scope recommendations and gain a better understanding about those.
- **Writing Support:** Prompts to find synonyms of different words to better structure my sentences.
- **Markdown Syntax:** Promts for various markdown formatting syntax in the PRD.
- **Identifying Competitors**: Prompts to help find competitors with similar application specs, their differences and links.
- **Future Iterations**: Prompts to better understand feasibility of future iterations.
- **Open Questions**: Prompts to  gain a better understanding of my open questions.

AI results were not always accurate and sometimes would generate information that did not align with my project pitch. I have reviewed and made plenty of edits to all the information in my final content.
