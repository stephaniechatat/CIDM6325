## Working with AI
This 2-week deliverable was supported by AI tools, specifically ChatGPT-5, in several key ways. AI assistance was used to:
- **Version control guidance:** Prompts that provided Git/GitHub commands for resolving some conflicts and pushing changes to repo.  
- **Risk Register:** Prompts that helped reformat the risk register information into a GitHub-friendly table.
- **System Sketch:** Prompts to help adjust and debug system sketch issues in Mermaid syntax.
- **Evidence Base:** Prompts in reformating the Evidence Base with authoritative sources in GitHub-friendly APA format.  
- **AI lightweight:** Prompts to better understand how AI micro summmarizer feature will flow within the application.
- **Scope:** Prompts for out-of-scope recommendations and gain a better understanding about those.
- **Writing Support:** Prompts to find synonyms of different words to better structure my sentences. 

AI results were not always accurate and sometimes would generate information that did not align with my project pitch. I have reviewed and made plenty of edits to all the information in my final content.
